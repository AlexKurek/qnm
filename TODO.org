* See if Lentz's method was actually worth it in terms of time/accuracy
* Dynamic control of step size in a
* Dynamic control of # terms in spectral expansion
* Validate by comparing against others' calculations
** DONE a=0 compared several (~10) low overtones against Berti's tables for s=l=0, s=l=1, s=l=2, and s=2 l=3.
* Ability to find QNMs at new points, starting guesses from known points
* Saving/loading computations to disk
** STARTED just for Schw, and only in bulk rectangles of modes
